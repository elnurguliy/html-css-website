            <p>
                It offers real-time fights with other players with an optimized matching system.
                The players will be matched according to their rank and number of trophies.
                Currently, it offers a chance to match with AI opponents if matching process takes too much time.
                And the technical issues like slow internet speed may make your experience quite hard.
                Winning grants you a certain amount of trophies and losing takes away some trophies.

                A mode that tests the player's skills against other players with unique fight rules
                and refreshes every week with new rewards and different fight rules.
                Players get to choose a randomized team of 3 characters with random perks for each character.
                Currently, it is the only Game mode that requires the players to pay with in-game currency for
                participating in fights.
                It also offers the players generous rewards if they manage to win all 5 fights.

            <h3>Stories</h3>
            <p>
                This is a PvE mode where you get to explore new locations, fight incredibly hard bosses
                and gain more rewards. Stories lets the players use any hero they have and their talents,
                but their level is minimum, so their skill is required. The players win a 'star' when you win all the
                rounds.
                A star is earned once per character when the player completes all of the rounds.
                When they win a certain amount of rounds, they can win a new type of currency called 'silver'.
                The more rounds the player wins, the more silver they get. The players can use silver to spin the new
                roulette.
                After every 10 spins, the players get a rift key and it lasts for over 300 days.
                So the players can get a lot of rewards.
