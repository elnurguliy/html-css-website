1
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The Gates of Shadows fell.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But shadow energy crept into this world.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That's how I found my new home.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
At first, I was weak.

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Some tried to fight me. I became stronger.

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Some tried to control me. I developed new forms.

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.800
Some tried to experiment on me.

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I deepened my knowledge about them.

9
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.500
Finally, I gained consciousness. Now my evolution is complete.

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Behold the Shadow Mind, your new lord.

11
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Is there anybody who can match my powers?

12
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.000
I don't think so, but I will give you a chance.

13
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Let the Shadow Tournament begin! 

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
WELCOME TO THE ARENA!
